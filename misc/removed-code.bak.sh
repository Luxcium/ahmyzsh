# This is the `ahmyzsh` MAIN bootloader it should be invoked (sourced) inside of
# /etc/zshenv the system-wide .zshenv file for zsh(1).
#
# To have minimal bash(1) support folow instruction in /etc/profile to include
# the code from instruction below or add code directly into the profile file
# folow instruction in /etc/profile...
#
# fist set `AHMYZSH` variable to be the path of the folder where
# ahmyzsh is located
# i.e. if the folder is in the root of your home folder then type this :
#
# without the backtics (`) -> `export AHMYZSH="${HOME}/ahmyzsh"`
# without the backtics (`) -> `source "${AHMYZSH}/MAIN_init.sh"`+
#
#  i.e.:
# export AHMYZSH="${HOME}/ahmyzsh"
# source "${AHMYZSH}/MAIN_init.sh"

# /etc/zsh/zshenv: system-wide .zshenv file for zsh(1).
#
# This file is sourced on all invocations of the shell.
# If the -f flag is present or if the NO_RCS option is
# set within this file, all other initialization files
# are skipped.
#
# This file should contain commands to set the command
# search path, plus other important environment variables.
# This file should not contain commands that produce
# output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.
#
# Global Order: zshenv, zprofile, zshrc, zlogin

# Â¬ !! /etc/zshenv
# export TIMER_ALL_THEN2=$(/usr/local/bin/gdate +%s%N) 2>/dev/null
